## Project Name: Bikeshare Project


### Project Description
This project was created during the udacity programming for data analysis nanodegree.
The project explores data related to bike share systems in three major cities in the US.
It imports data from csv files and computes descriptiv statistics from the data depending
on user input.

### Datasets
The data is provided by the US bike share system provider Motivate. The data files for all three cities contain the six columns:
* Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)
* End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
* Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
* Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
* End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
* User Type (Subscriber or Customer)

Two of the datasets (Chicago and New York City) also have the columns:
* Gender
* Birth Year

### Files used
Data files:
* chicago.csv
* new_york_city.csv
* washington.csv

Python-Script:
